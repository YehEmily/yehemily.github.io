<p class="roundedborders">I'm a <b>sophomore</b> pursuing a <b>B.S. in engineering with a concentration in computing</b> at the <b>Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</b>, the smallest and newest engineering college in Massachusetts that you've probably never heard of. But that's okay! There are plenty of pretty great schools out there. However, what makes Olin special (besides being established in 1997 and accepting under 80 students per year) is that <b>we learn by doing.</b> With a <b>projects-based curriculum</b> that's constantly evolving and growing, every Oliner has the <b>confidence</b> and <b>experience</b> necessary to hit the metaphorical employment ground running. Including me.</p>

<p class="roundedborders">Currently, I'm looking for a <b>summer internship</b> at a <b>software company</b>. I love <b>fast-paced environments</b> and <b>being challenged</b>. My goal at all times is to be the kind of person who <b>never stops improving</b>.</p>

<p class="roundedborders">Of the languages I have practical experience with, I'm the most comfortable with <b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b>, and <b>Matlab</b>. I'm also familiar with several other languages, although I may have little to no practical experience with them.</p>
