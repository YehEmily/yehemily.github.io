<p class="roundedborders"><b>Principles of Engineering: Line-Following Robot</b> <i>Fall 2016</i><br/>

In this lab, I worked with a partner and built a line-following robot, using an <b>Arduino UNO</b>, a motor shield, and two infrared reflectance sensors. We used the IR sensors to detect the presence of black tape, which formed a track on the ground for the robot to follow. Our controller logic used sensor information to compute the signals that must be sent to the motors to enable the robot to follow the line. Our controller uses bang-bang control, in which only two discrete commands are used; one command speeds up a motor and slows down the other,
while the other performs the same action on the opposite motors. <br/>

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Principles of Engineering: 3D Scanner</b> <i>Fall 2016</i><br/>

I worked with a partner in this lab to create a pan/tilt mechanism using two servos and one IR sensor, all of which were controlled by an <b>Arduino UNO</b>. Our goal was to create our own 3D scanner; this scanner would ideally be able to use our mechanism to obtain information about the distance between the mechanism and a 3D object - specifically, a cardboard "E" - then create a visualization of this object on our laptop.<br/>

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Principles of Engineering: DIY Bike Light</b> <i>Fall 2016</i><br/>
In this lab, I worked with another student to build a bike light with five different modes and varying frequencies using five LEDs, a potentiometer, and an <b>Arduino UNO</b>.<br/>

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Software Design: Harry Potter and the Biwizard Tournament</b> <i>Spring 2016</i><br/>
In partnership with one other student, I contributed to the creation of this Harry Potter-inspired dueling game, which was built using <b>Python</b>. In this game, the player battles against Voldemort and his legion of villains. Each enemy casts a number of spells, which inflict damage on the player. The player can return fire by waving their own wand in certain patterns, thereby casting spells. The game uses a model-view-controller organizational system, in which the mode contains the state of core gameplay mechanics (including hitpoints and spell-casting statuses), the view displays the game itself (using the pygame and OpenCV libraries), and the controller allows the player to use a "wand" (which is detected through OpenCV) to play the game.<br/>

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Software Design: Text Mining</b> <i>Spring 2016</i><br />
In this project, I analyzed text that I mined from Project Gutenberg's <i>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</i> and generated poems based on the frequency of words that appeared in Shakespeare's texts using <b>Python</b>. For example, articles like 'the' and 'a' appear quite frequently. Pronouns are second-most common, followed by more common nouns, more common verbs, and so on. In addition, I've always liked the doge meme, so I modeled my poems after the syntax of the meme. That is to say, many of the poems generated make very little sense, but they're pretty fun to read.

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Software Design: Gene Finder</b> <i>Spring 2016</i><br/>
I built a gene-finding program in <b>Python</b> that can accurately determine regions of the Salmonella bacterium's DNA that code for proteins. This program has the potential to be important to the field of bioinformatics because the protein-coding genes can begin to decode the form and function of these proteins. Once the functions of these proteins are known, their mechanisms can be understood.<br/>

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Mechanical Systems: Spinning Tops</b> <i>Fall 2015</i> <br/>
I worked in a team of 2 and focused on modeling the motion of mechanical systems using <b>MATLAB</b>. The mathematical models created involved systems of differential equations. The system my partner and I chose, a spinning top, was mathematically complex, in that it involved vector quantities instead of scalar quantities, and second order differential equations instead of first order. A spinning top rotates in all three planes, further complicating the model. In order to model the motion of the top, my partner and I took a crash course in linear algebra and implemented rotational matrices.</p><br/><br/><br/>

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Thermal Systems: Cubical Solar Oven</b> <i>Fall 2015</i><br/>Working with a partner, I simulated the transfer of heat from the environment to a cubical solar box oven with varying dimensions and compositions using <b>MATLAB</b>. The goal was to optimize a cubical solar oven. Specifically, we wanted to determine the dimensions and the composition that would allow a cubical solar oven to heat up as quickly as possible, given near-constant sunlight exposure.</p>
