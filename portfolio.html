				<h1>Interning at <span style="color: #fdca3b">Audible</span></h1>
			</center><br/>
			<p>
			<em>Audible is a subsidiary of Amazon that sells and produces spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio, and TV programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. Audible is the United States' largest audio book producer and retailer.</em><br/><br/>

			Last summer, I worked at Audible as an intern on the Romance team in Newark, NJ. The Romance team works on features for the Audible Romance package, which is a type of subscription to which Audible customers may sign up for a fixed monthly price. Once subscribed, Audible Romance customers have access to all Audible Romance books and can check out as many as they would like at no additional cost, for up to 10 books at a time. As an intern on this team, I became familiar with a wide variety of Amazon's internal tools and developed a new feature from backend to frontend. The feature that I worked on for my internship project was an indicator that would show Audible Romance customers the date on which they returned a book; this was something that customers had been requesting for a while; since subscribing to Audible Romance allows them to check out and return as many books as they like, the most avid readers often forget which books they have already read. Customers suggested that being able to see when they most recently returned a book would help them remember whether they had checked out the book before and jog their memory regarding how much of the book they had read.<br/><br/>

			My project touched upon databases, user experience design, and numerous Amazon internal services. I worked with several other teams and senior software developers, gaining valuable communication skills and becoming familiar with professional coding practices. With the help of my mentor and my team, I surmounted and learned strategies for dealing with technical challenges, such as working with a large and live codebase (in which packages are constantly altered or even deprecated). One neat programming practice that I learned about was automatic code generation; through my internship, I learned how to generate and use Java Service Pages, which in turn generated full webpages, as well as how to use automatic programming to generate service packages. Towards the end of my internship, as I was finishing up my project, I deployed my feature to a test environment and learned how to measure and mitigate the impact that my changes would have on the efficiency of the official Audible website.<br/><br/>

			Sadly, I didn't get to see my feature deployed to the main Audible website during my internship, but I've heard that it has recently been deployed, so Romance customers should be able to enjoy the results of my work from last summer very soon!</p>

			<em>Pivotal Software, Inc. is a software and services company which has divisions that perform consulting services (Pivotal Labs), work on cloud computing (Pivotal Cloud Foundry), and develop other big data products. One of these products is Pivotal GemFire, which is an in-memory distributed data grid for high-scale custom applications. GemFire is powered by Apache Geode, which is an open-source data management platform that provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud architectures.</em><br/><br/>

			During the summer after my sophomore year of college, I worked at Pivotal as an intern on the GemFire Management and Monitoring team. During this time, I worked on Pivotal GemFire and Apache Geode. I had the opportunity to pair-program with my teammates to squash bugs and develop new features and I learned the ropes of how a software company like Pivotal is operated. I participated in a workshop organized and run by Elisabeth Hendrickson, Pivotal's Vice President of Data Research and Development, which dove into agile development and how it can improve the productivity of any workplace. For three weeks I also worked with the refactoring guru Michael Feathers, author of <em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em> and <em>Brutal Refactoring: More Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em>, to improve the structure of the Apache Geode and Pivotal GemFire codebases.<br/><br/>

			While I was not assigned a specific project for my internship, I did have many opportunities to test and develop software for Pivotal. The work I did was often challenging and engaging, and I was always surrounded by people who were experts in agile development, concurrent systems testing, and intricacies regarding Pivotal's big data products. It was an honor to be able to contribute to Apache Geode, an open-source project that people all over the world have worked on, as well as Pivotal GemFire, a data management platform that is used by companies like GE and Indian Railways.<br/><br/>

			Since Apache Geode is open-sourced, its source code is publicly available. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apache/geode" style="font-weight: bold">If you're curious, you can take a look at it on GitHub here</a>.</p>

			<h1>Senior Capstone Project<br/>
			<span style="font-size: smaller;">in collaboration with <span style="color: #fdca3b">Toyota</span></span></h1>
			</center><br/>
			<p><em>At Olin College of Engineering, a fundamental part of our philosophy is that learning occurs through immersion in real-world applications. The final project that Olin seniors work on is a corporate consulting project, called the Senior Capstone Program in Engineering (SCOPE). SCOPE is a unique industry-university collaboration; over the course of a full academic year, seniors work in multi-disciplinary teams to provide innovative solutions to a companyâ€™s real-world problems. Sponsors retain full rights to all intellectual property developed by the team.<br/><br/></em>


			Toyota Motor North America's Social Innovation division seeks to make mobility a source of inspiration and a way to improve the quality of life for everyone. As part of this goal, Toyota partnered with my SCOPE team of five senior engineering students to add sensing and control functionality to power wheelchairs. We are collaboratively designing a solution with power wheelchair users to increase their independence in indoor environments.<br/><br/>

			On our team, I act as a co-product owner with one other team member, and together, we lead and direct the productivity of our team. We have completed significant user research in the first semester of SCOPE and our final semester will involve rapid prototyping and continuous collaborative development with our users.

			<h1>Software Systems<br/>
				<span style="color: #fdca3b">Multiclient Chat Room</span></h1>
			</center><br/>
			<p>
			<em>Software Systems is a course taught by Dr. Allen Downey at Olin College of Engineering. It's an introduction to the design and implementation of system-level software, including operating systems, networks, and databases. Some of the topics that this course covers include processes and threads, memory and storage management, networking and inter-process communication, scheduling and synchronization.</em><br/><br/>

			During the spring semester of my junior year of college, I worked on a team of three students to implement an online chat room in C with a server that hosts multiple clients, which can speak to each other and play games together. Through this project, we figured out what web applications with multiple concurrent users need, such as sockets and data structures used to store user information. We also figured out how to identify potential memory leaks and fix them. Lastly, we picked up numerous useful tricks for using C, which we utilized to make our code more efficient and easier to read.<br/><br/>

			Once implemented, our online chat room allowed anyone to join and start sending messages if they were connected to the same network as other clients. Some additional features that we implemented included allowing clients to change their usernames, allowing two clients to play rock-paper-scissors against each other, allowing clients to privately message each other, and allowing clients to disconnect from the room at any time. In the end, when the chat room server is shut down, our program frees all memory allocations.<br/><br/>

			Because C is a programming language that was mostly new to all of the members of the team, we found this project to be very interesting and challenging. We were able to achieve all of our original learning goals, in addition to learning some additional skills along the way, as we became more familiar with using GLib hashtables, string operations in C, and more advanced usages of pointers. One of the most valuable experiences during this project was debugging and understanding the errors that we found.<br/><br/>

			<h1>Complexity Science<br/>
				<span style="color: #fdca3b">Modeling Crime Networks</span></h1>
			</center><br/>
			<p><em>Complexity Science is a course taught by Dr. Allen Downey at Olin College of Engineering. It involves the study of complex systems and represents a new approach to science that investigates how relationships between parts give rise to the collective behaviors of a system and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment. Topics covered in this course include the structure and dynamics of complex networks; cellular automata, self-organized criticality, and generative systems; fitness landscape models of biological and technological evolution; and agent-based models of social and economic behavior.</em><br/><br/>
				
			During the fall semester of my junior year of college, I worked with another student to implement an agent-based model of a crime network based on a research paper that we studied. In our model, the agents are called Citizens and they inhabit a graph-like world called CrimeWorld, where each node is a street intersection. Each Citizen has several behaviors: they spend approximately 8 hours (the length of a work day) of their day moving around randomly in CrimeWorld, after which they return to their designated home and "sleep." They move randomly in one of the four cardinal directions for each time step. They can have two different roles: some Citizens are offenders (agents who commit crimes) and some are police (agents who prevent crimes). The offender agents share sets of characteristics, and for each time step, these characteristics help to determine whether they commit a crime or not.<br/><br/>

			After completing our initial model, my partner and I were interested in investigating what would happen if we added another factor that had not been present in our first model: the punishment of criminals who are caught. We therefore introduced a motivation characteristic for criminal agents and observe the results in our model.<br/><br/>

			The source code and final report for this project are publicly available. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ericasaywhat/SmoothCriminals" style="font-weight: bold;">If you're curious, you can take a look at both of these on GitHub here</a>.
