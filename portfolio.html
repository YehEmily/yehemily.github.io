			<em>Audible is a subsidiary of Amazon that sells and produces spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio, and TV programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. Audible is the United States' largest audio book producer and retailer.</em><br/><br/>

			Last summer, I worked at Audible as an intern on the Romance team in Newark, NJ. The Romance team works on features for the Audible Romance package, which is a type of subscription to which Audible customers may sign up for a fixed monthly price. Once subscribed, Audible Romance customers have access to all Audible Romance books and can check out as many as they would like at no additional cost, for up to 10 books at a time. As an intern on this team, I became familiar with a wide variety of Amazon's internal tools and developed a new feature from backend to frontend. The feature that I worked on for my internship project was an indicator that would show Audible Romance customers the date on which they returned a book; this was something that customers had been requesting for a while; since subscribing to Audible Romance allows them to check out and return as many books as they like, the most avid readers often forget which books they have already read. Customers suggested that being able to see when they most recently returned a book would help them remember whether they had checked out the book before and jog their memory regarding how much of the book they had read.<br/><br/>

			My project touched upon databases, user experience design, and numerous Amazon internal services. I worked with several other teams and senior software developers, gaining valuable communication skills and becoming familiar with professional coding practices. With the help of my mentor and my team, I surmounted and learned strategies for dealing with technical challenges, such as working with a large and live codebase (in which packages are constantly altered or even deprecated). One neat programming practice that I learned about was automatic code generation; through my internship, I learned how to generate and use Java Service Pages, which in turn generated full webpages, as well as how to use automatic programming to generate service packages. Towards the end of my internship, as I was finishing up my project, I deployed my feature to a test environment and learned how to measure and mitigate the impact that my changes would have on the efficiency of the official Audible website.<br/><br/>

			Sadly, I didn't get to see my feature deployed to the main Audible website during my internship, but I've heard that it has recently been deployed, so Romance customers should be able to enjoy the results of my work from last summer very soon!</p>

			<em>Pivotal Software, Inc. is a software and services company which has divisions that perform consulting services (Pivotal Labs), work on cloud computing (Pivotal Cloud Foundry), and develop other big data products. One of these products is Pivotal GemFire, which is an in-memory distributed data grid for high-scale custom applications. GemFire is powered by Apache Geode, which is an open-source data management platform that provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud architectures.</em><br/><br/>

			During the summer after my sophomore year of college, I worked at Pivotal as an intern on the GemFire Management and Monitoring team. During this time, I worked on Pivotal GemFire and Apache Geode. I had the opportunity to pair-program with my teammates to squash bugs and develop new features and I learned the ropes of how a software company like Pivotal is operated. I participated in a workshop organized and run by Elisabeth Hendrickson, Pivotal's Vice President of Data Research and Development, which dove into agile development and how it can improve the productivity of any workplace. For three weeks I also worked with the refactoring guru Michael Feathers, author of <em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em> and <em>Brutal Refactoring: More Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em>, to improve the structure of the Apache Geode and Pivotal GemFire codebases.<br/><br/>

			While I was not assigned a specific project for my internship, I did have many opportunities to test and develop software for Pivotal. The work I did was often challenging and engaging, and I was always surrounded by people who were experts in agile development, concurrent systems testing, and intricacies regarding Pivotal's big data products. It was an honor to be able to contribute to Apache Geode, an open-source project that people all over the world have worked on, as well as Pivotal GemFire, a data management platform that is used by companies like GE and Indian Railways.</p>
