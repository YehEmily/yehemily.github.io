		<h1>about <span style="color: #fdca3b">me</span></h1><br/>

		<p style="text-align: left">I'm a senior pursuing a B.S. in engineering with a concentration in computing at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, MA. I'm from Tacoma, WA, and I have also lived and worked in Portland, OR and Newark, NJ. My main programming language is Java, but I've also recently worked on projects in C and Python. I also really enjoy designing websites. I've designed and built more than 10 websites independently throughout my time in college for projects, friends, family, and faculty. I built this website from scratch using HTML/CSS, and I've also built sites using React and JavaScript, as well as microframeworks like Flask.

		<br/><br/>

		Last summer, I worked at Audible (an Amazon company) as an intern on the Romance team in Newark, NJ. I became familiar with a wide variety of Amazon's internal tools and developed a new feature from backend to frontend. The feature that I worked on for my internship project was an indicator that would show Audible Romance customers the date on which they returned a book; this was something that customers had been requesting for a while because the Romance genre allows them to check out and return as many books as they like, and as a result, the most avid readers often forget which books they have already read. My project touched upon databases, UX design, and numerous Amazon internal services. I worked with several other teams and software developers along the way, gaining valuable communication skills and becoming familiar with professional coding practices. I've heard that this feature has recently been deployed to the Audible website, so Romance customers should be able to enjoy the results of my work from last summer very soon.

		<br/><br/>

		At work I'm a team player who is always enthusiastic and positive, a tenacious worker who can't give up on a problem before she has truly tried everything, and a lifelong student who is always learning and improving. In my free time I'm an avid reader, a musician and music appreciator, a short-distance runner, a graphic designer, and a mixed media artist.

		<br/><br/>

		Currently, I'm looking for a post-graduation job at a software company. I want to work for people I can learn from and with whom I can do things that are fun, valuable, fulfilling, and challenging. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:emilyeyeh@gmail.com">emilyeyeh@gmail.com</a> about your particular business interests or if you have any questions.

		Thanks for visiting my website!
