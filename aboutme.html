		<h1>about <span style="color: #fdca3b">me</span></h1>

		<p style="text-align: left">I'm a senior pursuing a B.S. in engineering with a concentration in computing at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts. My main programming language is Java, but I've also recently worked on projects in C and Python. I also really enjoy designing websites; I've designed and built more than 10 websites independently throughout my time in college for friends, family, and faculty. I built this website from scratch using HTML/CSS, but I've also used React and JavaScript before, as well as microframeworks like Flask.

		Last summer, I worked at Audible (an Amazon company) as an intern on the Romance team in Newark, New Jersey. I became familiar with a wide variety of Amazon internal tools and learned how to develop a new feature from backend to frontend. The feature that I worked on for my internship project was an indicator that would show Romance customers the date on which they returned a book; this was something that customers had been requesting for a while because the Romance genre allows them to check out and return as many books as they would like, and as a result, the most avid readers often forgot which books they had already checked out. My project touched upon databases, UX design, and numerous Amazon internal services. I worked with several other teams and software developers along the way, gaining valuable communication skills and becoming familiar with professional coding practices. I've heard that this feature has been recently deployed to the Audible website, so Romance customers should be able to enjoy the results of my work from last summer very soon.

		During the previous summer, I worked at Pivotal as an intern on the GemFire Management and Monitoring (M&M) team. During this time, I worked on Pivotal GemFire and its open-source counterpart, Apache Geode. I had the opportunity to pair-program with a number of employees to squash bugs and create features and I learned the ropes of how a software company like Pivotal is operated. I participated in a workshop organized and run by Elisabeth Hendrickson, Pivotal's VP of Data R&D, which dove into agile development and how it can improve the productivity of any workplace. I also worked with acclaimed author Michael Feathers, who visited the Beaverton office to teach and assist the M&M team in refactoring and improving their code base.

		When I'm not working or sleeping, I'm an avid reader, a musician and music appreciator, a short-distance runner, a graphic designer, a charcoal-smudged artist, a casual foodie, and a dependable friend. When I am working, I'm a team player who is always enthusiastic and positive, a tenacious worker who can't give up on a problem before she has truly tried everything, and a person who learns from criticism graciously and quickly. Also, I can type about 100 words per minute with 99% accuracy, so jot that down.

		<br/><br/>

		Currently, I'm looking for a post-graduation job at a software company. I want to work for people I can learn from and with whom I can do things that are fun, valuable, fulfilling, and challenging.
