<p class="roundedborders">I'm from the small town of <b>University Place, Washington</b> and I moved to <b>Needham, Massachusetts</b> to study at <b>Olin</b>. Becoming excellent at programming and computer science is my dream, but I also love <b>art</b>. I'm a pianist in Olin's Conductorless Orchestra and I'm independently studying piano performance. Some of my performances can be seen on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktXp4YIpmTw-ZM0F3ToE-Q"><b>Youtube channel</b></a>.</p>

<p class="roundedborders">One of my favorite coding challenges so far has been Project Euler. In my spare time, I've solved 30 of these half-coding-half-math problems. Some of my solutions can be found in <a href="https://github.com/YehEmily/ProjectEuler"><b>my Github</b></a>.</p>

<p class="roundedborders">This semester, I'm currently enrolled in <b>four technical classes.</b><br /><br />

<b>Principles of Engineering</b>: A course in which everyone practices the analysis, design, construction, testing, and debugging of real and useful electromechanical systems. While working with a partner, so far, I have built a bike light, a three-dimensional scanner, and a line-following robot. Currently, I'm working in a team of five to build an automated marionette play.<br /><br />

<b>Foundations of Computer Science</b>: Like a typical computer science course, this class explores the formal analytic tools of computer science as well as aspects of algorithmic computing and intelligent software design. It combines elements of automata theory, data structures and algorithms, programming languages, artificial intelligence, information management, and internet programming.<br /><br />

<b>Data Structures</b>: This course, unlike all of my other courses, is offered at Wellesley College in partnership with Olin. It teaches data abstraction, modularity, performance analysis, and standard abstract data types. It's a course taught in Java, with a special focus on object-oriented programming.<br /><br />

<b>Linearity II</b>: The goal of this course is to introduce advanced topics in vector calculus, multivariable calculus, and applications of differential equations. There is a heavy emphasis on both numerical and analytical approaches to problems.</p>

<p class="roundedborders"><b>Programming languages</b>: Java, Python, Matlab, HTML/CSS, LaTeX, Arduino C, Racket/Scheme<br/><br/>
<b>Other technical skills</b>: GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, SolidWorks </p>
